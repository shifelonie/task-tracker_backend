as you can see from this repository title, it's only the backend or the server side. 
if you wondering where's the frontend or the client side, it's my friend's jobdesk :)

so this an application that i made using javascript framework Express.js for the backend and for the database i use PostgreSQL. I also use Prisma ORM so that i don't have to write all of the queries to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE data from tables from the database.

if you want to try testing the API, you can use Postman or any application that has the same uses like Postman.
